# Threagile AI Threat Modeling Action

Automatically generate and validate threat models from your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files using Threagile's AI-powered analysis.

## Features

- üîç **Automatic IaC Scanning**: Discovers and analyzes Terraform, Kubernetes, and CloudFormation files
- üõ°Ô∏è **Trust Boundary Detection**: Automatically identifies security boundaries from network topology
- üìä **Risk Analysis**: Identifies and categorizes security risks in your infrastructure
- üí¨ **PR Comments**: Provides detailed threat analysis directly in pull requests
- üö¶ **CI/CD Integration**: Fail builds based on risk thresholds

| `model-path` | Path to generated threat model |

## Examples

### Fail on High Risks

```yaml
- name: Threat Model with Risk Gate
  uses: threagile/threagile-action@v1
  with:
    fail-on-high-risk: true
```

### Custom IaC Directories

```yaml
- name: Scan Multiple IaC Sources
  uses: threagile/threagile-action@v1
  with:
    iac-dirs: 'aws/,azure/,k8s/deployments/'
```

### Merge with Existing Model

```yaml
- name: Update Existing Threat Model
  uses: threagile/threagile-action@v1
  with:
    merge-with: 'docs/threat-model.yaml'
    output-file: 'docs/threat-model.yaml'
```

### Use Specific Version

```yaml
- name: Use Specific Threagile Version
  uses: threagile/threagile-action@v1
  with:
    threagile-version: 'v1.2.3'
```

## PR Comment Example

When `comment-on-pr` is enabled, the action will post a detailed analysis:

```
## üõ°Ô∏è Threagile Threat Model Analysis

### Model Generation
- **Mode**: simple
- **IaC Directories**: terraform/,k8s/
- **Output**: threagile-generated.yaml

### Risk Summary
- **Total Risks**: 12
- **High/Critical Risks**: 3

#### Critical Risks
- **Unencrypted Data Store**: Database accepts unencrypted connections
- **Internet-Facing Admin Interface**: Administrative interface exposed to internet

#### High Risks
- **Missing Network Segmentation**: No network isolation between tiers

### Generated Files
- [Threat Model](threagile-generated.yaml)
- [Risk Report](report.pdf)
- [Risk Details](risks.xlsx)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Required**: Please review and address high/critical risks before merging.
```

## Supported IaC Formats

- **Terraform**: `.tf`, `.tf.json`, `.tfvars`
- **Kubernetes**: `.yaml`, `.yml` (with `apiVersion`)
- **CloudFormation**: `.yaml`, `.json` (coming soon)
- **AWS CDK**: TypeScript/Python (coming soon)
- **Helm Charts**: `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` (coming soon)

## Security Considerations

- The action only reads IaC files and never modifies them
- No credentials or secrets are extracted from your infrastructure
- All analysis is performed locally within your GitHub Actions runner
- Generated threat models can be reviewed before committing

## Troubleshooting

### No Risks Found

If no risks are identified:
1. Ensure IaC directories are correctly specified
2. Check that files have proper extensions
3. Verify IaC files contain actual resources

### Action Fails

If the action fails:
1. Check the logs for parsing errors
2. Ensure Threagile version is compatible
3. Verify file permissions in the repository

### PR Comments Not Appearing

If PR comments don't appear:
1. Ensure `github-token` has proper permissions
2. Verify the workflow runs on `pull_request` events
3. Check that `comment-on-pr` is set to `true`
