# AI Threat Model Generation - Testing Summary

## What We Built

We've implemented an AI-powered threat model generation feature for Threagile that automatically creates threat models from Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files.

### Key Features:
- **Terraform Parser**: Recognizes AWS resources (EC2, RDS, S3, ELB, Lambda, VPC)
- **Kubernetes Parser**: Recognizes Deployments, Services, Ingress, Storage
- **Context Integration**: Reads CLAUDE.md files for project context
- **Trust Boundary Detection**: Automatically groups assets by network/namespace
- **Communication Detection**: Infers connections between components
- **JSON Output**: CI/CD friendly output format

## Quick Test (1 minute)

```bash
# 1. Build Threagile
make all

# 2. Run minimal test
./minimal-test.sh
```

This creates a simple threat model from one Terraform file to verify everything works.

## Full Test Suite (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Setup test environment
./setup-test-demo.sh

# 2. Run all automated tests
./run-ai-tests.sh
```

This runs 10 test cases covering:
- Terraform parsing
- Kubernetes parsing
- Mixed infrastructure
- Context file integration
- Error handling
- JSON output

## Manual Testing with Your Website

If you have existing infrastructure files:

```bash
# Point to your infrastructure directory
./threagile ai-generate --iac-dirs /path/to/your/website/infrastructure/

# View the generated model
cat threagile-generated.yaml

# Run threat analysis
./threagile analyze-model

# Generate PDF report
./threagile analyze-model --generate-report-pdf
```

## Test Files Created

1. **TEST_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive test plan with 10 test cases
2. **setup-test-demo.sh** - Creates sample infrastructure files
3. **run-ai-tests.sh** - Automated test runner
4. **minimal-test.sh** - Quick verification test
5. **QUICKSTART_AI.md** - User guide for the feature

## Expected Results

When you run the tests, you should see:
- ✅ Terraform files parsed into technical assets
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests converted to container assets
- ✅ Trust boundaries created for VPCs and namespaces
- ✅ Communication links between load balancers and servers
- ✅ Data assets for databases and storage
- ✅ Context from CLAUDE.md applied to the model

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Try with real infrastructure**: Point to actual Terraform/K8s files
2. **Customize the output**: Edit the generated YAML to add details
3. **Run full analysis**: Use Threagile's risk analysis on the generated model
4. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Use JSON output in your pipelines

## Troubleshooting

**No assets found?**
- Check that files have .tf, .yaml, or .yml extensions
- Ensure files contain resource blocks (Terraform) or kind/apiVersion (K8s)

**Build errors?**
```bash
go mod download
make clean
make all
```

**Permission denied?**
```bash
chmod +x threagile
chmod +x *.sh
```

## Feedback

The feature is in MVP stage. Current limitations:
- Simple pattern matching (not full HCL parsing)
- Limited resource types supported
- Basic communication detection
- No merge functionality yet

Feel free to test with your real infrastructure files and report any issues!
