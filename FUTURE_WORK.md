# Future Work Items - AI Integration

These items are to be completed after reboot:

## High Priority
1. **Implement proper HCL parser for Terraform** (currently using pattern matching)
2. **Implement detailed mode generator** with comprehensive analysis
3. **Implement model merge functionality** (currently stubbed)
4. **Complete context application logic** (more fields from CLAUDE.md)

## Medium Priority
5. **Add CloudFormation parser**
6. **Add Pulumi parser**
7. **Create advanced trust boundary detection algorithms**
8. **Implement model validation with rules engine**

## Lower Priority
9. **Add comprehensive integration tests**
10. **Create example projects and documentation**
11. **Test with real-world complex infrastructure**
12. **Add source code analysis for API endpoints**

## Current Status
- Phase 1 MVP is complete and pushed to GitHub
- All tests are passing
- Ready to continue with these Phase 2+ features after reboot
